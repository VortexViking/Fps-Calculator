This application is a simple FPS calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps users determine how long each picture (frame) should be displayed in a video editor based on a desired FPS (frames per second). Here's how the application works:

1. When you open the application, you'll see a window with two input fields and a button:
   - The first input field is where you enter the total number of pictures (frames) you plan to include in your video.
   - The second input field is where you enter the desired FPS (frames per second), which represents how fast the images should be displayed.

2. After entering the number of pictures and FPS, you click the "Calculate" button.

3. The application then calculates:
   - How long each picture should be displayed (in seconds) to match the given FPS.
   - The total duration of the video in seconds, assuming all pictures are used at the specified FPS.

4. These results are displayed below the button, showing:
   - How long each picture needs to be displayed for.
   - The total time the video will last based on the number of pictures and FPS setting.

5. At the bottom of the window, there is a clickable link labeled "Made by Vortex Viking." When clicked, it opens the YouTube channel associated with the username (youtube.com/@IamVortexViking) in your default web browser.

This tool is particularly helpful for video editors who need to convert a series of pictures into a video while ensuring they adhere to a specific frame rate (FPS).
